- Read `package.json` to understand what tools we use and how we run scripts/common commands
- Always type check after making changes
- Lint and format after every update
- NEVER use type assertions (`as X`) - `as const` is fine and good! `satisfies X` is great, keep types as narrow as is reasonable
- Try not to define the same type or annotations in multiple places - single source of truth is best
- For Python code, format with `ruff`, type-check with `pyright`, use `uv` for everything
- Do NOT edit `.env.local`
