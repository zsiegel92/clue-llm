*Ilya Sutskever on why next-word prediction requires real understanding and reasoning:*

> "Say you read a detective novel complicated plot a storyline different characters lots of events Mysteries like Clues... at the last page of the book the detective has got all the clues gathered all the people and saying okay I'm going to reveal the identity of whoever committed the crime and that person's name is **predict that word**... by predicting those words better and better and better the understanding of the text keeps on increasing... in order to predict that next word figure out from all of the agents that were there and all of their strengths or weaknesses or their intentions and the context and to be able to predict that word who who was the murderer **that requires some amount of reasoning a fair amount of reasoning**"
