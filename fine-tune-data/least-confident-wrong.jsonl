{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"# Clue Logic Puzzle\n\nDetermine who the killer is based on the following information:\n\n## How to Solve This Puzzle\n\nThis is a logic deduction puzzle. Your goal: identify which ONE person is the killer.\n\n**The Core Logic:**\n- If someone can be proven to have been with ANY attribute (technology, place, company, institution, food, or material), they have an ALIBI\n- Having an alibi means you are NOT the killer\n- The killer is the ONLY person who cannot be proven to have any alibi\n- Eliminate everyone with alibis to find the killer\n\n**Reading Propositions:**\n\nDIRECT ALIBIS (person is definitely NOT the killer):\n- \"X was with Y\" → Person X has alibi, so X ≠ killer\n- \"X was with Y (alibi: not the killer)\" → Explicit alibi for X\n\nCONDITIONAL ALIBIS:\n- \"If X was with Y, then X is not the killer\" → IF you can prove X was with Y, then X has alibi\n\nDISJUNCTIONS (OR statements):\n- \"(A with X) OR (B with Y)\" → At least one is true. Cannot directly eliminate anyone unless you can prove one side false\n- \"(A with material M) OR (B with food F and institution I)\" → Similar logic for complex ORs\n\n**Step-by-Step Method:**\n1. First pass: Mark all people with direct alibis as NOT the killer\n2. Second pass: Look for OR statements where you can deduce which branch must be true\n3. Third pass: Apply conditional statements if their conditions are met\n4. The remaining person with NO alibis is the killer\n\n**Critical:** Every suspect except ONE will have at least one alibi. Find the person who has ZERO alibis.\n\nThink carefully and work through each proposition systematically before deciding.\n\n<input>\n**Suspects:**\n- Joe\n- John\n- Bob\n- Will\n- Jane\n- Linda\n- Susan\n- May\n\n**Propositions:**\n1.
